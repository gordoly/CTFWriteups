# CTF Write-ups


## About


This repository contains write-ups of multiple capture the flag boxes from Hackthebox and one from Tryhackme. These write-ups document the methodology I used for the enumeration and exploitation of vulnerabilities, in order to obtain root user on each of these boxes.


## Viewing the write-ups


To read a write-up for one of the boxes, click on one of the directories above. The directory name corresponds to the name of the box. Then, click on the file that ends with `.md` - this file contains the write-up. GitHub will render the markdown file, allowing you to read the write-up.
